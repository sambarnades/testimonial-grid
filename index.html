                      I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
                      in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

                    ‚ÄúI was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                    the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

              <p>‚ÄúBefore joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
              professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
              did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
              project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
              could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
              experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend!‚Äù
